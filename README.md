##Description
A clip that attaches to a barbell that notifies the user via buzzer that the ba$
is uneven to help the user with their form and reduce injury.

##Inspiration
In the gym, I've seen many people benching alone, lifting the bar unevenly, wit$
even knowing they were doing so. This is a common problem in the hobby, without
a realistic fix other than having a friend with you.
